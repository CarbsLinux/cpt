KISS PACKAGE MANAGER
====================

My personal fork of [KISS] which is a simplistic
package manager by Dylan Araps. Changes are minor
but are things that wouldn't be/aren't liked by Dylan.

I will follow upstream releases while maintaining my
own changes. This fork will NOT be on the Carbs Linux
repositories. I have plans for this in the future, just
not yet.
