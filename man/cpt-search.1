.Sh EXAMPLES
Below are usage examples for
.Nm ,
which is a simple yet powerful utility for querying packages.
.Ss Using wildcards
.Nm
expands POSIX shell wildcards when searching for packages.
.Bd -offset indent -literal
$ cpt-search 'emacs*'
/home/cem/repos/main/community/emacs
/home/cem/repos/main/community/emacs-nox
/home/cem/repos/kiss-community/community/emacs
/var/db/cpt/installed/emacs
.Ed
.Ss Limiting search to a single package
When the
.Fl s
flag is given,
.Nm
will only output the first instance of the package.
.Bd -offset indent -literal
$ cpt-search -s emacs
/home/cem/repos/main/community/emacs
.Ed
.Pp
Here is what happens when I don't use the
.Fl s
flag:
.Bd -offset indent -literal
$ cpt-search emacs
/home/cem/repos/main/community/emacs
/home/cem/repos/kiss-community/community/emacs
/var/db/cpt/installed/emacs
.Ed
.Ss Removing installed database from the search results.
When you use the
.Fl d
flag,
.Nm
will omit the installed package database from the result. Using the above
.Em emacs
query with this flag will result in:
.Bd -offset indent -literal
$ cpt-search -d emacs
/home/cem/repos/main/community/emacs
/home/cem/repos/kiss-community/community/emacs
.Ed
.Ss Searching other instances of the current package
Sometimes you want to check whether there are other instances of your package,
especially if you are using multiple repositories from different sources. Let's
say that you are in the
.Pa ~/repos/main/community/emacs
directory and you want to know whether this same package exists in a different
repository. You then run the following command:
.Bd -offset indent -literal
$ cpt-search -od
/home/cem/repos/kiss-community/community/emacs
