#!/bin/sh -e

# This is a simple package manager written in POSIX 'sh' for
# KISS Linux utlizing the core unix utilites where needed.
#
# The script runs with 'set -e' enabled. It will exit on any
# non-zero return code. This ensures that no function continues
# if it fails at any point.
#
# Keep in mind that this involves extra code in the case where
# an error is optional or required.
#
# Where possible the package manager should "error first".
# Check things first, die is necessary and continue if all is well.
#
# The code below conforms to shellcheck's rules. However, some
# lint errors *are* disabled as they relate to unexpected
# behavior (which we do expect).
#
# KISS is available under the MIT license.
