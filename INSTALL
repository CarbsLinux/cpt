Installation Instructions
=========================

In order to install cpt, you either need a redo implementation on your system,
or use the `do` script inside the `minimal/` directory (which is slower but the
source code isn't that big anyways).

Paths and version information can be configured from the `config.rc` file or
through environment variables.


Installing from a git checkout
------------------------------

On the git checkout of the repository, the info page for the package manager
doesn't exist. The build system looks for `makeinfo` in order to build the info
page, but exits with success if it isn't on your system. That's why you
shouldn't edit the MAKEINFO variable even if you don't have it on your system,
it is optional.


With redo

    redo
    DESTDIR= PREFIX=/usr/local redo install
