## How does each operator work?

### `kiss build pkg`

Kiss's `build` operator handles a package from its source code to the installable `.tar.gz` file. Sources are downloaded, checksums are verified, dependencies are checked and the package is compiled then packaged.

### `kiss checksum pkg`

Kiss's `checksum` operator generates the initial checksums for a package from every source in the `sources` file.

### `kiss install pkg`

Kiss's `install` operator takes the built `.tar.gz` file and installs it in the system. This is as simple as removing the old version of the package (*if it exists*) and unpacking the archive at `/`.

### `kiss remove pkg`

Kiss's `remove` operator uninstalls a package from your system. Files and directories in `/etc` are untouched. Support for exclusions will come as they are needed.

### `kiss list` or `kiss list pkg`

Kiss's `list` operator lists the installed packages and their versions. Giving `list` an argument will check if a singular package is installed.

### `kiss update`

Kiss's `update` operator compares the repository versions of packages to the installed database versions of packages. Any mismatch in versions is considered a new upgrade from the repository.
