getopt from util-linux
----------------------

This is the standalone getopt build from util-linux. This is used in cpt
seperately so that the program doesn't depend on any outside source. See COPYING
for copyright information. The config.h was generated by running the following
command on the original source directory.


    ./configure \
        --disable-all-programs \
        --enable-getopt
