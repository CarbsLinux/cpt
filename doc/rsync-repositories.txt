RSYNC REPOSITORIES

RSYNC repositories are simple to serve and simple to use. In the repository
directory, there needs to be a '.rsync' file that points to the remote of
the repository. This is used in order to fetch changes from the upstream.
'.rsync' file looks like this for the core repository:

    rsync://carbslinux.org/repo/core

RSYNC repositories have some few distinctions when it comes to fetching
them. Unlike GIT repositories, they don't have a defined "root" directory.
When there are multiple repositories in a shared repository (such as the
Carbs Linux and KISS Linux repositories), individual repositories need to
have this '.rsync' file. This doesn't, however, slow down operations.
Fetching from rsync repositories are still considerably faster and smaller.


SETTING UP AN RSYNC REPOSITORY

Carbs Linux repositories automatically sync from the git repostitories
and serve it through the rsync daemon. Here is a sample shell script
that I use in order to sync repositories. Feel free to customize for your
own use.


    #!/bin/sh
    HOSTNAME=rsync://carbslinux.org/repo
    GITDIR=/pub/git/repo
    SHAREDIR=/pub/share/repo
    _rsync() { rsync -aC --delete --exclude=.rsync "$@" ;}

    git -C "$GITDIR" pull
    _rsync "$GITDIR/." "$SHAREDIR"

    # For some reason the core repositories were not synced
    # so I resorted to this solution
    for dir in "$GITDIR/"*; do
        [ -d "$dir" ] || continue
        _rsync "$dir/." "$SHAREDIR/${dir##*/}"

        [ -f "$SHAREDIR/${dir##*/}/.rsync" ] ||
            printf '%s/%s\n' "$HOSTNAME" "${dir##*/}" > "$SHAREDIR/${dir##*/}/.rsync"
    done


You can then create an 'rsync' user for serving the repositories.

    -> adduser -SD rsync


Create '/etc/rsyncd.conf' and a service configuration as well.

rsyncd.conf:

    uid = rsync
    gid = rsync
    address = example.com
    max connections = 10
    use chroot = yes

    [repo]
            path = /pub/share/repo
            comment = My Repository


/etc/sysmgr/rsync or what have you:

    #!/bin/sh
    exec rsync --daemon --no-detach
